Underperformance triggers resource allocation. When there is underperformance, teams dedicate more resources.
Underperformance also triggers scrapping in severe cases; scrapping lowers resource allocation but may reset performance.
Low performance leads to rework; rework can improve design quality over time. Better design increases performance.
Improved performance reduces underperformance.
